        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p id="description">
          <strong>Glaceon</strong> (Japanese:
          <b id="japanese">グレイシア</b> Glacia) is an Ice-type Pokémon
          introduced in Generation IV. It evolves from Eevee when it is leveled
          up near an Ice Rock or exposed to an Ice Stone. It is one of Eevee's
          final forms, the others being Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Espeon,
          Umbreon, Leafeon, and Sylveon.
        </p>
        <h3>Biology</h3>
        <p id="biology-p1">
          Glaceon is a quadruped, mammalian creature covered in light-blue fur
          that can be frozen into sharp quills. It has long, pointed ears, dark
          eyes, and a small nose. A teal crest with two dangling flaps adorn its
          head, resembling hair or headgear. Glaceon has two dark blue,
          rhombus-shaped markings on its back; the tip of its tail, feet, and
          flaps are the same shade of blue.</p> 
          
          <p id=biology-p2>By controlling its body temperature,
          the moisture in the air freezes, producing ice crystals surrounding
          it. It is capable of freezing its fur into sharp needle-like icicles,
          used to tackle its prey. It can drop its body temperature below -75
          degrees Fahrenheit. Those captivated by Glaceon's beautiful snowfall
          will be instantly frozen without realizing it. Glaceon is rather
          popular in ski resorts due to its ability to create powdery snow.
          Glaceon is usually found in urban areas under the care of humans. It
          is rarely found in the wild.
